    Class to be used by UC Fuzzy Challenge competitors to create a fuzzy logic controller
    for the Asteroid Smasher game.

    Note: Your fuzzy controller class can be called anything, but must inherit from
    the ``ControllerBase`` class (imported above)

    Users must define the following:
    1. __init__()
    2. actions(self, ship: SpaceShip, input_data: Dict[str, Tuple])

    By defining these interfaces, this class will work correctly

         A ship controller class for Kessler. This can be inherited to create custom controllers that can be passed to the
        game to operate within scenarios. A valid controller contains an actions method that takes in a ship object and ass
        game_state dictionary. This action method then sets the thrust, turn_rate, and fire commands on the ship object.
